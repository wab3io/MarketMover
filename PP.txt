- **No Personal Data**: We do not collect names, emails, or other personal details beyond your Discord ID, which is publicly available via Discord.
- **Voluntary Participation**: Data is only collected when you interact with the Bot (e.g., reacting with ðŸ“ˆ/ðŸ“‰ or using !predict, !bet, !leverage).

3. How We Use Your Information
- **Gameplay**: User IDs and points are used to track your predictions and calculate point gains or losses.
- **Local Storage**: Data is saved locally and not transmitted to third parties or cloud services.
- **Improvement**: Aggregate, anonymized data may be used to improve the Bot, but no individual data is shared.

4. Data Sharing and Disclosure
- We do not sell, trade, or transfer your data to third parties.
- Data may be disclosed if required by law or to protect the safety of the Developer or users (e.g., in case of abuse).

5. Data Security
- Data is stored in a local JSON file with restricted access on the Developer's device.
- While we take reasonable precautions, no method is 100% secure, and the Developer is not liable for unauthorized access due to external factors.

6. Your Rights
- You can request deletion of your data by contacting the Developer at [your.email@example.com] or via Discord DM to [your Discord username].
- Deletion requests will be processed within a reasonable time frame, removing your user ID and points from the Bot's records.
